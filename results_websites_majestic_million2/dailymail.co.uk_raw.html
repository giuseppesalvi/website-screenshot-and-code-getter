        Towards the end of the agonisingly long and drawn-out inquest into the death of 16-year-old Ben Nelson-Roux, a poignant video was played in the coroner's court, at his parents' request. Overlain with tributes from his friends and his maths tutor, it showed an exuberant boy enjoying a wholesome upbringing in the most affluent part of Yorkshire. Here was Ben, enjoying outdoorsy holidays with his father, Barry Nelson, 57, a global operations manager with Mastercard, and mother, Kate Roux, 47, a massage therapist and Tai Chi teacher, who responsibly and lovingly co-parented him after their separation.

      A Polish heiress accused of being a 'call girl' who conned her genius financier lover out of a huge chunk of his £18million estate by his brother in a bitter High Court battle has been found dead, MailOnline can reveal. Magdalena Zalinska, 44, a nightclub boss, was being sued by Edi Truell over claims she obtained £4million from Danny by 'undue influence' before he died of a neurological condition aged 55 in 2019. But the case has taken a mysterious twist after her body was discovered by police who broke down the door of her apartment in Clapham, south London, when officers on a routine patrol were approached by neighbours who were concerned for her welfare. Police have confirmed to MailOnline that Ms Zalinska's sudden death is not being treated as suspicious, but unexpected. The divorced mother-of-two was at the centre of a acrimoneous fight with the family of millionaire former Golman Sachs banker, Danny. Ms Zalinska, 44, who was left more than £1million in Mr Truell's will, denied the allegations, insisting they had a 'romantic and loving relationship' for 14 years.

       Ruth Perry (left), who was married with children and had been principal at Caversham Primary School in Reading since 2010, took her own life in January this year believing the result was a 'complete injustice'. Ms Perry claimed inspectors told senior staff they had seen a boy 'flossing' - a popular dance move with tens of millions of children around the world - and that this was evidence of the sexualisation of pupils at the school. It's also alleged inspectors told teachers that they had seen child-on-child abuse - but Ms Perry insisted it was a playground scuffle.

            The victim, only known as Luise (left) under Germany's strict privacy laws, had reportedly been bullied by her two attackers for months. When she told an adult about the bullying, the girls aged 13 and 12 stabbed her 30 times 'in revenge' in the woods in her hometown of Freudenberg in North Rhine-Westphalia. Last Saturday, March 11, Luise reportedly met the 13-year-old friend at her house in the town's Hohenhain district, 1.8 miles away from her own home. While they knew each other for years, took the school bus together, and were even in the same class in school, it is not clear why Luise and her killer met up in light of the bullying accusations. Later that day, the 12-year-old accomplice joined in and the trio walked to a nearby forest. There (bottom right), they stabbed Luise more than 30 times with a knife in&nbsp;a case that shocked Germany. Luise's body was found in the woods the following day, March 12, during a massive police search of the area (top right and inset) after her parents reported the girl missing on Saturday afternoon.

            Oxfam came under fire last night for issuing a bizarre 'inclusive' language guide to staff. The 92-page report warns against 'colonial' phrases such as 'headquarters', suggests 'local' may be offensive and says 'people' could be patriarchal. Workers were told 'parent' is often preferable to 'mother' or 'father', terms such as 'feminine hygiene' should be dropped, and 'people who become pregnant' should be used instead of 'expectant mothers'.

       Thousands took to the streets across France to express their fury at the measure on Thursday, setting fires to property and fighting the police. The demonstrations were triggered by&nbsp;Macron's government using a controversial constitutional mechanism to crash a bill through the National Assembly to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. The Senate adopted the bill earlier on Thursday morning, but misgivings in the ruling party and reluctance by right-wing opposition MPs to side with Macron meant the government risked losing a vote in the lower house and instead chose to use article 49.3 of the constitution. The government now faces motions of no confidence as opposition politicians say France is on the edge of a 'democratic breakdown'.

            Dozens of extra marshals have been recruited to prevent people from taking the al fresco option as part of a wider war on antisocial behaviour at Cheltenham. Photographers snapped one desperate racegoer urinating against a wall outside a busy shop. While his six friends went into the bustling convenience store, the man, in his early 20s, walked over to the wall a few feet away, undid his flies and answered the call of nature in front of dozens of people. Also pictured are other racegoers this year.

            Kim Kardashian swapped the sunny climate of Los Angeles for London on Thursday with a surprise appearance at Emirates Stadium. The reality superstar was snapped in the stands while watching Arsenal take on Sporting CP in the second leg of their Europa League match. Cutting a low-key figure in the VIP area, she was joined by her son Saint, seven, for the game. Showing he's quite the fan, the little one donned a signature Arsenal football top while watching the action unfold - as his ultra-famous mother wrapped up in a white jumper.

        As well as layering up with thick coats, scarfs in the winter to stay cozy our bodies have also developed several ways of staying warm. But children stay warmer because they have more brown fat.

            Balbinder Singh, who lives in Mickleover, a suburban village of Derby, claims he is still trying to get problems fixed that have been there since he moved in back in April 2021. Avant Homes said issues have been caused by the construction of an extension that impacted his warranty. Now, almost two years on, Mr Singh claims the company is ignoring him. In a desperate bid to heap pressure on Avant Homes, Mr Singh, who lives on the Cotchett Village estate, has put up a sign that reads: 'Avant Homes our review. We moved in on April 1, 2021 and work is still uncompleted. Avant is no longer responding to us. There is lots of uncompleted work. We are happy to share pictures. Don't make the mistake we made.'

            A man on a night out celebrating his new job died in a tragic accident after he tripped over a step outside his door. Alex Murray, 31, (pictured) spent the day drinking with friends in various pubs in Blackburn, Lancashire, on October 1, last year, ahead of starting a new job days later in Cleveleys. Assistant Coroner Sian Jones returned a conclusion of accidental death for Alex, whose father also appears to have died just months before. Alex's family said he was 'loved by everyone' and tributes flooded in for the 'true gent loved by so many'.&nbsp; His friend Chris McKenzie said Alex was 'a true gent that I am so thankful to have known'.&nbsp;His sister said: 'This year has dealt us some bad blows and I need your help. Alex was loved by so many so let's give him the send off he deserves.'

            A yacht chartered by six shadowy operatives with fake passports, explosives delivered to the crew in the dead of night, and a mysterious paramilitary group outside the control of a nation state. These are ingredients in a compelling new theory that's beginning to emerge for the unsolved bomb attacks against the $20 billion Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines on September 26 2022. The huge explosions caused an estimated $500 million of damage and leave serious doubts about whether this major infrastructure network, built to transport gas from Russia to Western Europe, will ever be repaired. The attack triggered an ongoing blame game between Moscow and the West as international authorities struggled to pinpoint a culprit.

       Is Harry sabotaging the King's plans for a slimmed-down monarchy? That is the question being posed to royal experts in the unmissable royal talk show Palace Confidential. While Prince Harry 's decision to give his children titles may have disrupted King Charles III's vision for the Royal Family, the king may yet have a trick up his sleeve. A couple of days after the announcement from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex that their children Archie and Lilibet would be known as prince and princess, Buckingham Palace announced that Prince Edward would be promoted to the Duke of Edinburgh. Speaking on the Mail Plus talk show Daily Mail Diary Editor Richard Eden said that King Charles 'could hardly justify not giving his brother the title that he'd been promised by their parents,' after the Sussexes announcement. It was widely thought that the King 'didn't intend' to give his brother the title, held by their father, due to his wider plans of trying to 'slim down the monarchy.'

            Partygoers from around the world have captured their antics on camera while honouring the patron Saint of Ireland, and shared their revels on social media. This frequently-memed image, jokingly captioned 'Irish Yoga', shows three women supposedly passed out in an array of acrobatic poses, the floor around them strewn with empty bottles (top right). Left: A real tongue twisters. Bottom right: An unorthodox cure for the flu.

            For the past decade, the Princess of Wales has taken part in the tradition of handing out shamrock to the Irish Guards on St Patrick's Day. Wearing the celebratory green, she has attended the St Patrick's Day parade eight times, meeting officers, indulging in a sip of Guinness and even playing with the Guards' mascot - a friendly Irish wolfhound. Despite an awkward high heel mishap and a fainting guard, the princess has consistently brought glamour and her beaming smile to the festivities over the years. For her first parade in 2012, which was also her first solo military engagement, the princess sported an elegant emerald green coat by Emilia Wickstead paired with a chocolate brown Lock &amp; Co hat. As part of the century-old custom, Kate handed out sprigs of shamrock to the Officers and Guardsmen which were then distributed among the ranks, keeping calm after one officer fainted in his uniform and bearskin hat.

        Noel Coward may well have been the greatest theatrical animal of the 20th century, the author of classic plays. But there is no doubt he was also the most accident-prone.

            Question Time producers left Fiona Bruce 'carrying the can' after she was accused of trivialising domestic violence, a former BBC executive has said.

Her actions on the show sparked a backlash and 854 complaints from those accusing her of not taking seriously enough the issue of domestic violence. But Roger Mosey, the corporation's former head of television news, said bosses could have edited her remarks out because the programme was pre-recorded. Mr Mosey told Roger Bolton's Beeb Watch podcast: 'It's an editorial question about what Fiona Bruce says.

            Millions of prisoners across the globe are incarcerated in some of the highest security penitentiaries - which are run with military precision. Many of the maximum-security prisons are held in the highest regard, with few ever having a breach made by an inmate - but it hasn't stopped some from trying. Some of the toughest centers in the world have held the most notorious criminals, including Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán, the leader of Mexico's Sinaloa drug cartel, and Unabomber Theodore 'Ted' Kaczynski, 79. Cameras that track prisoners 24/7, electronically controlled doors, motion sensors and perimeter fences are just some of the things keeping prisoners locked up in their cells. Some allow prisoners to speak during mealtimes, while others create an environment to strip people of their individuality -&nbsp; often not referring to them by their names. As a mega-prison El Salvador prepares to open its doors yet again for another wave of violent criminals, DailyMail.com takes a look at the more impenetrable prisons across the globe.

       UK startup Kerbo Charge has this month announced the rollout of its groundbreaking self-closing cable channel for electric car owners, which runs through the pavement. It costs from £999 to have installed, but based on the average difference in charging bill for domestic energy prices compared to public charging costs, the system will - in theory - pay for itself within 12 months. The product eliminates trip hazards for pedestrians when electric car owners run their charging cables over the footpath in order to tap into their domestic energy supply. Here, we also explain about the legal ramifications of creating a potential risk for pedestrians with a charging lead running over the pavement...and who is liable if it results in a personal injury claim.

            Cher showed off the diamond ring she was gifted by her much younger boyfriend Alexander 'A.E.' Edwards during an outing in Los Angeles on Thursday. The legendary musician, 76, styled the massive rock with flared blue jeans, an army green windbreaker and stylish snakeskin boots. She first rocked the sparkler in a photo shared to Twitter on&nbsp;New Year's Eve, which showed her getting a kiss on the cheek from her toy boy, 37.

            A coroners' court built next to an ancient Clapham churchyard is on the market for £3.5million - after it was converted into a three-bedroom house. The three-bedroom home was built in 1901 by London County Council as a coroners' court, where dead bodies were examined and public inquests were held to decide how people had died during Edwardian times. Located in Clapham, South London, the property comes with three reception rooms and two bathrooms, as well as an additional coach house. The site the court was built on was adjoined to the ancient Clapham churchyard, which had been closed for burials for over 40 years, next to the local mortuary.

       A former soldier has today dramatically saved his clifftop house from the wrecking ball after managing to drag it back 10ft from the abyss. Lance Martin's victory came after more than 24 hours of frantic efforts to move the wooden property using huge diggers, but just after midday he raised his arms in triumph as the structure began to shift just inches. The former Grenadier Guard had been given a 'high noon' deadline by officials from Great Yarmouth Borough Council, telling him that if the contractors were unable to move the house significantly by 12pm, the council would have to consider issuing a demolition order. Mr Martin's rag-tag army of friends, neighbours and contractors whose men and plant were borrowed from a nearby holiday park in Hemsby, Norfolk, toiled all yesterday and this morning to get the wooden structure to shift. As the deadline loomed, they fed a thick canvas strap underneath the back of the property, and attached it to a telegraph pole braced against the back edge of the structure. As one digger hauled on the strap, a second smaller one managed to shift one corner of the building a fraction, at which point Mr Martin, 65, raised his arms in joy and hugged friends and supporters.

       Sporting FC were level just after the hour mark and in remarkable circumstances as the attacking midfielder, 24,&nbsp;spotted the England goalkeeper off his line. The 24-year-old joined Sporting in the summer of 2020 after a season at top-flight side Famalicao. Goncalves had a two-year stint at Wolves from 2017 to 2019, joining Nuno Espirito Santo's side when they were in the Championship. And fans were quick to react with one saying: 'I'm not blaming anyone in the team for that goal. Pedro Goncalves is not sane, he is not normal. He is insane. Insane. Wow.'

       This&nbsp;is the shocking moment a McDonald's bouncer body shoves a customer to the ground. The footage was captured outside the fast food restaurant at St John's in Leeds, West Yorkshire, on Saturday night. The bust up is said to have happened after security ejected another customer for eating in the queue.

       The disabled woman who had her wheelchair pushed down a flight of stairs on camera by the son of a former NHL player has spoken publicly for the first time. The woman, who goes by Sydney on social media, slammed hockey player Carson Briere and declined $8,000 raised for a replacement chair, while Mercyhurst suspended Briere and two others from all team-based activities. Sydney made a statement Wednesday night on Twitter alongside a photo of herself with an employee of the bar where her chair was pushed, Sullivan's Irish Pub in Erie, Pennsylvania.

            The recent social media trend of showing off spacious, bright, clean and perfectly organized pantries is rooted in racist, classist and sexist social structures, according to a professor from Chicago. Associate Professor of Marketing Jenna Drenten said she took note of a recent uptick in what she branded 'pantry porn' - when women show off their fully stocked, methodically styled home supply closets. In particular, Drenten singles out ultra-influencer celebrities like the Kardashians for proliferating the trend as they show their millions of followers their pristine storage rooms.

The merry students were seen huddling in circles as two individuals took turns leaping on one another and fighting while the crowd around them jeered and screamed. Some of the women on Spring Break also got involved in the chaos - getting down in the Florida sand as they tussled and tackled with one another during the football drills.

Appearing on the latest edition of Antiques Roadshow from 18th century Belmont House in Kent, one of the highly prized awards was on display after being obtained by its current owner for a mere £200.

            Raffle&nbsp;the rescue pooch may now be in doggy heaven, but his name lives on - in the form of a 200million-year-old fossil he discovered. The remarkably complete remains of a plesiosaur from the Jurassic era have finally gone on display, 16 years after Raffle stumbled across them at Lyme Regis in Dorset. Aged nine in 2007, he was on a walk with owner Tracey Barclay when he took a rest on top of an exposed vertebra bone which was recognised by Ms Barclay - an amateur fossil hunter. Eventually the whole fossil was dug up and after 15 years of painstaking preparation it is on public display at the Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre near Lyme Regis. Raffle died in 2013 but his rare find, preserved within the fossil-rich ammonite pavement at Monmouth Beach, has now been named after him.

        BRIAN VINER: Rye Lane is as black as Notting Hill was white and draws much of its humour and vibrancy from the strong Afro-Caribbean heritage in South-East London.

            Aniah Warne, 21, from Boise, Idaho, gave a tour of her one-room abode on TikTok after a viewer pointed out that she lives in a shed. 'I do live in a shed. This is my shed,' the college student said with a smile. The space is eclectically decorated with a tapestry hanging above the bed, plenty of plants, floating shelves, posters, and a salt lamp. Warne panned the camera around the backyard to show that she is just steps away from her parents' home, where she uses the bathroom and kitchen.

            A series of photographs depicting the graphic details of the First World War, taken by an unknown soldier in the trenches, is up for auction this weekend, for a guide price of £300. In one image (left), a courageous but exhausted soldier stares down the barrel of the camera as he sits in the mud of the trenches. Other pictures show the devastating impact of constant shelling on the landscape (centre) as soldiers prepared to attack the deadly No Man's Land (right).

       Astonishing bodycam footage has captured the moment an Oklahoma police chief begs officers to turn their camera off as he tries to wriggle out of a DUI arrest. Captain James French, 55, was returning home from a poker game when he was pulled over for driving erratically. French slurs as he tries to explain to officers that he is in fact a captain for the force's Investigations Bureau, having been employed there for 32 years. 'I'm the captain of the police department,' he says in the embarrassing footage shared by the Oklahoma City Police Department (OCPD).
